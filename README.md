# Boston Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is a part of **AI & ML Internship - Task 3** which focuses on implementing and understanding simple & multiple linear regression.

## 📌 Objective

To predict Boston housing prices using a Linear Regression model and evaluate its performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² score.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Boston Housing Dataset** (available via sklearn)
- Features include crime rate, number of rooms, distance to employment centers, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## ✅ Steps Covered

1. Data Loading and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Train-Test Split
4. Model Training with `LinearRegression()`
5. Evaluation using:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - R² Score
6. Coefficient Analysis

## 📈 Output

- The model was able to predict housing prices with decent accuracy.
- MAE, MSE, and R² values were computed to measure performance.
